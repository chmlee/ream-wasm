# REAM

REAM is a data language for building maintainable social science datasets.
It has three main components:

- a *data serialization language* or structured datasets (working in progress)
- a *data template language* to generate datasets (planned)
- a collection of *filters* to manipulate data (planned)

More information about the language can be found in the [documentation](https://ream-lang.org).
